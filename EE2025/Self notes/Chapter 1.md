#### Transmission Lines
- Low frequency - circuit elements like resistors, capacitors and inductors are sufficient to analyse the circuit
- High Frequency - The space starts playing a role in the working of the circuit

#### High Frequency and Microwave circuits
- Discontinuity in circuit -> EM radiation
- Transit time not ignorable

#### Antennas
- In their absence,The comm which can be established within few watts would require MW of power.

	- EM Wave theory is imp in the analysis of lasers and photo detectors.

#### Electromagnetic Inference(EMI)
- Heavy currents in circuits might produce EM radiations which interfere with the other circuit elements affecting their overall performance.
- Shielding techniquies are employed to protect circuits.
