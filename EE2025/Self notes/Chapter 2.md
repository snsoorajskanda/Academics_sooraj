##### Transit Time Effect
Signal requires a finite time to travel along the circuit which is not negligible compared to the time period of the signal (at higher frequencies)

-  As the frequency ω increases, inductive reactance(ωL) and capacitive susceptance(ωC) increases proportionately making reactive effect more observable.

take lim as Δx -> 0
- Complex propogation constant

- βx represents the phase of the wave with β being the 'phase constant'

- The amplitude of the wave travelling in +x direction at location x on the line is

- alpha here represents 'attenuation constant'
- unit is neper/metre
- 1 neper is equivalent to 8.68 dB. A unit amplitude voltage wave will reduce to 1/e over a distance of 1 metre.

- we take the distance from load towards generator as l as shown
![[Pasted image 20220802163934.png]]
- we define a paramter which gives the relative amplitudes of the two waves at any point on the line.  called - 'Reflection Coefficient'
- It is given by :
![[Pasted image 20220802164248.png]]
- it defines the complex relation between the reflected voltage wave and the forward or incident voltage wave at any location l on the line.
- Higher the value of this coefficient, indicates more reflection from the load end
