example 1.15 op!
- A is independent of B <=>B is independent of A
 ![[Pasted image 20220809135635.png]]
- A and B are independent <=> A' and B are independent <=>A and B' are independent <=> A' and B' are independent

#### Conditional Independence :
![[Pasted image 20220809140349.png]]

If C is known to have occured, the additional information that B also has occured does not change the probability of A

This condition

Is not a condition for independence of these events

If an expt has a sequence of independent but identical stages , we say that we have a sequence of independent trials
