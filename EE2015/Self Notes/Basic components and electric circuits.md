Linear circuit analysis can be separated into four broad categories:

(1) dc analysis, where the energy sources do not change with time;
(2) transient analysis, where things often change quickly
(3) sinusoidal analysis, which applies to both ac power and signals
(4) frequency response, which is the most general of the four categories, but typically assumes something is changing with time.
