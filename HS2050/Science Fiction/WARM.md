- Author : Robert Sheckley

- There are no usual themes of SF like Technology, futuristic ideas etc
- Anders is in love with Judy and he is going to propose her(A very different theme from SF)
- It is not actually a love story, but the beginning tricks the reader into believing so
- "Help me" - The beginning of his love story's end(LOL)
- Initially he replies to the voice with humor, assuming that it could be his inner voice and didn't take it seriously
- Schizophrenia : Schithz - o - phren - iya (A mental disorder characterised by delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thoughts, speech and behaviour.)
- "But Anders had a lamentable confidence" - Lamentable because of what was to follow
- He was telipathically in contact with another person's voice
- Orderly universe is disarranged, fabric of belief is ripped : The definition of SF
- The voice in this story seems to look for something unnatural, abnormal

- Lemming is a bird that jumps of the cliff(Suicide) : "A lemming in love" - A light hearted statement
- Whenever he doubts himself or his sanity , he defeats his own logic : It gets warmer
- The moment when he decided to propose : Fatal existance of fatful moment

	- What is reality?
	- We don't really see reality, by the time light reaches our eyes, the reality would have changed
	- We just see an approximation for reality
	- Reality is a sort of relative view

- His perception was becoming sharper. He is able to differentiate different types of smiles
- There is a change in his ability to percieve things, this leads to the voice feeling warmer
- Phatic converstion : A small talk before the actual topic(eg : if a person is at cinema hall, asking "have you come to watch a movie?") - A fundamental part of communication
- He is able to see things that are beyond obvious
- The voice is making him to find a meta-meaning of the conversation
- “Teaching psychology to young apes” - Doesn't take teaching too seriously
- gestalt : A very imp concept in Psycology : You are able to see a person based on their physical appearance - Shape, pattern, walk etc. The ablility to distinguish one thing from other clearly

- “ I was thinking about you today,” - He was able to see thechange in  mood beyond 
- Ander saw things very clearly, but he hated himself for seeing it. You would want your people to be ideal, and not actually how they are. 
- Don't be a linear thinker, think in all directions(Lateral thinker); Look at things from above
- “Good-bye,” - good bye from his old way of looking at life, good bye from sanity
- All the experiences are intellectual
- masquerade - Already you wear a mask, upon that you pretend, you are two steps away from real you (in the party)
	- Too much of anything makes us mad
- We are all atoms, we are a part of the cosmos filled with atoms
	- Never trust atoms;Coz they make up everything (xd)
- Anders looked at the masses of atoms that were pretending to solidity, meaning and reason
	- Is the fact that everything is atoms is real?
	- Is it that anything solid is real?
	- Hindu Philosophy says everything is an illusion(maya)
	- In his perception, everything became a part of him

- There are lots of things which we believe which don't really happen - Absurd philosophy
- He has slowly erased everything. Everything is nothing
- Ever the stars disappear
- The Zen doctrine eventually means there is no mind
- A sense of circularity at the end(He became the voice and asks for help from himself)
- A loop - the voice becomes man. and he becomes voice
- He himself is nothing anymore, everything is an illusion
- The voice is a part of the big illusion. It doesn't matter

# Pakka 1 question for endsem

### Analysis
- Def of SF
	- 1) The purpose of ALL SF is to challenge our fundamental assumptions of reality
	- 2) The purpose of SF is to subvert the existing order by presenting alternative societal models

- Why is warm an SF?
	- Warm challenges our fundamental assumptions of reality by displaying everything as atoms and not by what we identify them. Eg : The beggar
	- Generally we have a linear understanding of time, but warm has a cyclic understanding of time.
	- Here warm does not present alternative societal models, but it does subvert the existing order

- Gestalt theory : Science of psychology
	- Principle of totality : 
		- Conscious experience considered globally. Everything becomes part of his consciousness
	- Principle of psychophysical isomorphism:
		- The correlation between conscious experience and cerebral activity

				 Psychology is considered as soft sciences

Q) Justidfy WARM as SF.  (probable endsem question)

- 'Evolution to higher self' is part of SF 
	- We have seen this in arena, sentinel

				 Douglas Hofstadter - Rodel,Escher and bach(Read 
                 this book without fail)

- Self actualisation - Peak experience(Oceanic feeling) : At the end , anders starts questioning everything including what an atom is
- Satori /   : terms for self actualisation
- Warm is a story where Science fiction and Spirituality meet each other

- Space time confusion : Another reason why this is SF

- How are all these related to a modern man?
	- Loss of identity
	- Plethoria of choices
	- Loss of recognition of good and bad
	- Modern schizophrenia
