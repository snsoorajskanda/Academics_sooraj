#### Analysis

- Author questions the supremacy of men over women
	- Why don't women write?
	- Why are men portrayed as heros and women are shown as side characters

- Why do people/ women dress up , especially in silk and ornaments?
	- To display their status in the society
	- Women are considered ornamental
	- Kind of a ritual which has been normalised in the society ; if you dress ordinarily, people make fun of you

- Gender roles: 
	- "Katy drives like a maniac" - It destroys established notion of gender roles
	- Here, only a single gender exist and gender roles are destroys.
	- Janet and katy are two people with two different personalities : need not be associated as gender roles
	- It is usually the role of a man to hunt, drive, pull apart a car and put it together etc on the world we know : but women took up them; they are proving that they are strong enough by doing these activites
	- Janet and katy complement each other wrt to skills; Janet good with rifles while katy is not ; Two views: 
		- Author has not really succeded in removing gender roles(giving complementary attributes to katy and janet appears like janet takes male role)
		- She was somewhat successful in establishing gender equality; by putting female with supposedly male attributes(like hunting etc) : Proving that we can have a society without men

- Technology is used:
	- Joanna russ has used "Technology - merging of two ova to reproduce" : to remove the requirement of man
	- They don't need men anymore : A society could be self sufficient with only women

- Feminism:
	- Generally Feminism means 'women are equal to men' ; but Joanna Russ eliminates men(her view of feminism)
	- This is a feminist SF

- Social SF: 
	- Does this story imply on societal values?
	- Traditional gender roles are social constraints
	- Women need to show that they are capable to survive independently
	- a) Biological : Merging of ova
	- b) Cultural -  1) Dress: 'women don't dress so plainly' ; 'Dress like a 
                                   bride'
						    2) Language: 
							    You talk in a way others talk; 'He'/'his' ; 
						        He turned his head-those words have not been in our language for six hundred years
						        'A great tragedy' : He means that its a tragedy as there are no men. But they had not seen men in their entire life

- When it changed - Significane: 
	- There are no men - A change
	- Men came back - A change
	- Use of other worlds to comment on our world
	- Justify the title "when it changed"

- What does Joanna Russ achieve by this SF story:
	- Women without men are independent, happy and are able to lead trouble less society
	- with men , there are always problems; men want to use women in order to colonise 
	- Men won't let women be independent
	- Society in whileaway is a utopia(Not completely, maybe 98%) in a feminine point of view
	- But it can also be seen as distopia from earth point of view
