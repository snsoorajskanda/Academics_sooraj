Author - PHILIP K DICK

- Aliens made up of plasma, are reporting this story.
- 3 kinds of people
	- Those who believe - Theist(Elms)
	- Those who do not believe - Atheist(Travis)
	- Those who neither believe nor disbelieve - Agnostic(Rautavaara)

- Acosmic Pantheist

- Two narrative situations : (He(Author) was Called Gnostic Prophet)
	- What is reality?
	- Who is a human being? - Is he the (form + brain) or just brain

- The extraterrestrial species were considered approximations(by humans) and they found it offensive
- Help is not always recieved. Should we help?
	- We need to make sure that person needs help. 
	- Verify the facts
	- Help the genuine

- Here the aliens try to help agneta by extracting nutriments from her own body

- Time pertrubation is an essential part of science fiction(Basis of this story)
- Plasma beings think a brain is sufficient to be called a human. Physical form has no significance
- They see Jesus Christ - Somatic forms think she's Hallucinating
	- Can we believe in god? It could just be our Hallucination

- Agneta : 
	- She is hallucinating(More rational way of thinking)
	- She is actually seeing Jesus Christ(Having faith and believing in our idea of god)

- Travis is an atheist who is rejecting this form of god. He may not be rejecting the other forms of god(May be as a pillar etc)

- Hindus believe that once moksha is attained, there is no rebirth
- Agneta believes that Christ has come to take them(Analogy to moksha)
- Humans seem to not believe what brain sees to be real.(This does not necessarily mean that they are atheist)

- Plasma beings introduce their version of god into the brain. This can be viewed as a kind of experiment
- God ate Travis. The other two were terrified. Plasma believed that the real salvation is when the saviour consumes beings. Its a blessing for them if god consumes them

- EU Christ : They consume a slice of bread(Seen as god's flesh) and a red drink(Symbol for blood of god)

- Humans believe that god should serve us, while plasma believe that they should serve god
- Human's beliefs are more symbolistic. Plasma beliefs are real(real consumption of body)

- Philip is putting two kinds of beliefs about god and gives us a choice.

#### Analysis

- Gnostic prophet - Other side of the mind(There is one part of the mind which is focussing on the present activity, along with that there are other thoughts.  There are some thoughts we suppress - 'Eg: calling a teacher bad')
	- The aliens don't suppress their curiosity of experimenting with the mind
	- The two different ways of beliefs : Humans consuming god symbolically; What if god consumes us... Depicts Gnostic mindset of author

- He believes that there is nothing called absolute reality('emperical world' - what we can clearly see existing)
- He says that emperical world exist, along with that there are other beings and other worlds(swarga, moksha) 
- Self realisation - 'ultimacy'  : Selflessness leads to self transcendence(nirvaana)
- Dick has 2 narrative situation
	- Simulacra - Comprises of machines like Robots, androids etc and how they affect humans
	- Alternative reality - The other beings (plasma)
