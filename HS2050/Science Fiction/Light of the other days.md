"The Light of Other Days" is a classic science fiction short story by Bob Shaw.

It is about [slow glass](https://everything2.com/title/slow+glass "slow glass"), glass which takes light an extended period of time to go through. After its maufacture, it is typically placed in [scenic locations](https://everything2.com/title/scenic+locations "scenic locations"), affording people with [spectacular views](https://everything2.com/title/spectacular+views "spectacular views"). The thing that makes the story a classic is that slow glass works both ways. A character spends his days outside his house, looking in at the images of his dead wife, who lives on, for a few more months, in the depths of the [slow glass](https://everything2.com/title/history "history").

### BOB SHAW
- British [Science Fiction](https://everything2.com/title/Science+Fiction "Science Fiction") author (Belfast, 31 December 1931 - 12 February 1996), best remembered for the invention of [slow glass](https://everything2.com/title/slow+glass "slow glass").
- With only his third published story, "[Light Of Other Days](https://everything2.com/title/Light+Of+Other+Days "Light Of Other Days")" (1966), Shaw hit the big time. This is the story that first introduces "[slow glass](https://everything2.com/title/slow+glass "slow glass")", and it was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula. Although it didn't go on to win either of these awards, it has gone on to become one of SF's all-time classics, and has been anthologised dozens of times.

### Slow glass
Slow glass is a concept first introduced by Bob Shaw in his 1966 short story "[Light of Other Days](https://everything2.com/title/Light+of+Other+Days "Light of Other Days")".

In an ordinary transparent medium, such as air, glass, or water, the speed of light is reduced from [what it is in a vacuum](https://everything2.com/title/speed+of+light+in+a+vacuum "speed of light in a vacuum"). The difference in light speeds between two media is what causes [refraction](https://everything2.com/title/refraction "refraction") at their boundary: think of a [prism](https://everything2.com/title/prism "prism"). The actual difference in speed, however, is relatively small.

Now imagine a pane of glass in which the speed of light is so slow that a ray can take as long as _years_ to traverse it. This is _slow glass_. The thickness of a pane is no longer measured in centimetres or inches, it's measured in days, weeks, or years.

Imagine what you can do with it. If you've got a pane that's twelve hours thick, you can put it outside during the day, take it inside at night, and have sunlight around the clock! Or you could take panes several years thick, place them somewhere scenic, and allow them to soak up the natural beauty for a while. Later, you harvest them, hang them in your city house's window frames, and you've got an instant view of the [mountains](https://everything2.com/title/mountains "mountains")! (Until all the light from the mountains has passed through, at which point, you're looking out at the street below, only several years ago.)

Imagine also the scope for crime. As a crooked glazier, you could craftily replace someone's window with 24 hour thick slow glass, and they won't see you stealing their car until a day later. Think of the perfect [alibis](https://everything2.com/title/alibi "alibi") you could manufacture!

But what about [surveillance](https://everything2.com/title/surveillance "surveillance")? Drop a tiny shard of slow glass in your competitor's boardroom, then have your [spy](https://everything2.com/title/spy "spy") in the janitorial staff vacuum it up a couple of days later. Pop it under a [microscope](https://everything2.com/title/microscope "microscope"), and _voila_: revealed are those trade secrets!

Slow Glass is one of the most memorable truly original science fiction concepts. [Shaw](https://everything2.com/title/Bob+Shaw "Bob Shaw") struck to the emotional heart of it in "[Light Of Other Days](https://everything2.com/title/Light+Of+Other+Days "Light Of Other Days")", which was justly nominated for the Hugo and Nebula, and has gone on to become one of the [most anthologised SF stories ever](https://everything2.com/title/most+anthologised+SF+stories+ever "most anthologised SF stories ever"). He developed it further in the fixup novel _[Other Days, Other Eyes](https://everything2.com/title/Other+Days%252C+Other+Eyes "Other Days, Other Eyes")_ (1972), which leads the reader through stories on all of the themes noted above, and builds up to the conclusion of an almost [dystopian](https://everything2.com/title/dystopian "dystopian") world of ubiquitous surveillance.

## Summary
The narrator is touring northwest [Scotland](https://en.xn--fragmentwiki-ieb.vn/en/Scotland "Scotland") with his wife Selina. Their relationship is in trouble, and news of her pregnancy has made it worse. Their holiday, intended to improve the situation, has not been a success. Travelling through a remote area, they find a place that sells panes of slow glass. This is glass that light takes a long time to pass through, even years, so that a pane of this glass shows a scene from the past. People buy slow glass that has been placed in [picturesque scenery](https://en.xn--fragmentwiki-ieb.vn/en/Scenic_overlook "Scenic overlook") so that later they can enjoy the view in their homes or workplaces. The best quality slow glass is priced by its "thickness", corresponding to the number of years of scenic view contained within it. The narrator thinks that an extravagant idea like buying slow glass might set right his relationship with Selina.

Leaving the car, they walk along a path, where they see panes of slow glass facing a view of a [loch](https://en.xn--fragmentwiki-ieb.vn/en/Loch "Loch"). They meet Mr Hagan, who is sitting on a low wall in front of his stone farmhouse and looking towards the house. Inside, through the window, they see a young woman, presumably Mrs Hagan, and a small boy. Hagan fetches a rug from the house so that Selina can sit on a wall. The narrator, sensing that Mrs Hagan, looking towards them from inside, is not aware of them, wonders if she is blind; Selina remarks that her dress is out of fashion.

The narrator discusses with Hagan the price of his slow glass. Hagan says how fine the view is from there; as he talks, the narrator, still looking at the house, wonders if the small boy is blind as well. Eventually, although Selina is not impressed, the narrator decides to buy. While Hagan is fetching the glass, rain begins, so Selina goes to the house to return the rug. When the door is opened, the interior is seen to be disordered and squalid; Hagan is living alone. The family scene of wife and child was of years ago, seen through slow glass. As the couple leaves with their purchase, Hagan sorrowfully tells them his wife and child were killed in a road accident six years previously.

The narrator, walking with his wife back along the path, feels their relationship is somehow strengthened. He looks back at Hagan, who is sitting at his usual place, looking towards the house.

### Other readers insights
-  I also appreciated Shaw’s wry observations about marriage and the emotional interplay between the narrator and his wife.
- What this story is most notable for, though, is the introduction of slow glass to the genre of science fiction. Shaw uses slow glass, a kind of time in a bottle device, to explore the concepts of memory, reality, and time.
- "beauty lives though lilies die”
- A curiously futuristic yet old-fashioned story
- the cruising in the car, the worrying about a pregnancy and the two nuclear families, very post-World War II baby-boomer era
- “Some men who live alone are good housekeepers; other just don’t know how.” This is some of the worst sexism from my point of view
- “Everyone…will look back…and think that it’s the best. That’s the parlor trick of nostalgia, and it’s why nostalgia is the worst. It’s a toxic impulse … The idea that things were better once and are terrible now and getting worse every minute is what fuels the worst, in my opinion, movements in contemporary culture.” - John Hodgman
- As a relatively young person, I’ll often hear people who go on wistfully about how things used to be in their pasts. People regret not enjoying the past, and I see people repeating this pattern over and over – ignoring the present in favour of hankering after the past. It’s a vicious cycle where people ignore the great things of the present and the potential in their present. People focus on how things are worse now but forget the wonders of the present.
- An arguement could be made that slow glass just preserves the memory for once. A screensaver or a display could be more nourishing. But we need to keep in mind the fact that story was written in 1966
- A simple SF story without the other worlds concept. An attempt to explain the Fictional concept of slow glass and nothing more

### Questions
1.  Explain why Shaw starts the story with the characters arguing. What have they learned by the end of the story?
	- Wanted to make a statement about importance of familial relationships
	- 

2.  Is it necessary to the story that the main character is a poet?
	- Since the title of the story was inspired by a poem(Thomas Moore - Light of the other days), the main character is chosen to be a poet
	- This is one way in which author could give a tribute to Thomas Moore for using his work in the story
	- 

3.  How plausible is the invention of “slow glass”? Is an understanding of the “science” in this story necessary for a complete enjoyment of the story?

4.  Compare the use of slow glass to the use of home movies.
