- Hagan was compared to elderly road-menders and philosophers as they are experienced and know what they are doing. Hence they have calm composture : "He had one of those calmly dismayed faces one finds on elderly road-menders and philosophers." - Self realisation.

- "My feeling was that selina and i were perhaps blundering through an emotional interplay as violent as our own" - Initial impression - Hagan was stingy : But now they felt that their interpretation was blundered.
